Given an expression with paranthese, this program will correctly calculate the value of the expression with 
correct order of operations. 

--------------------NOTE--------------------
CircIntLL files were modified for O(1) runtime for stack functions 

parser.cpp will create a "converted.txt" where it will translate the original expression file into 
 version that can be pushed onto the stackint. converted will also kill all the empty lines. 

--------------------TO RUN------------------
for makefile, 
	type "make"
	run by ./parser/(your expression file name)
